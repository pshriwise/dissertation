Methods for modeling radiation transport determine particle flux, or derived
quantities, across space, angle, energy and time. The combination of the space,
angle, energy, and time domains is known as \textit{phase space}. The behavior
of these particles is described by the lnear Boltzman transport
equation\cite{Ulam_1949}. Deterministic solve this transport equation by discrectizing
the phase space of the problem, but time and memory constraints often limit the
resolution of phase space in practical problems.

The Monte Carlo approach to modeling Radiation transport simulates the
interaction of individual particles across the phase space\cite{Lewis_1993}. This method was
developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) during World War II by Fermi,
von Neumann, Ulam, Metropolis, and Richtmyer\cite{LANL_1987}. It uses a random walk process to
solve the transport equation. Pseudo-random numbers are used to sample
probability distribution functions representing the virtual medium and in turn
determine the particle interaction outcomes. This stochastic approach requires
the simulation of many particles to reduce the statistical uncertainty of the
solution, where the uncertainty is inversely proportional to the square root of
the number of particles simulated. As the number of simulated particles
approaches infinity, tallied quantities approach the value of the continuous
solution.

The pros and cons of the two approaches complement each other. While
deterministic approaches inherently calculate a solution over the entire problem
domain, they take on additional error by discretizing phase space. In contrast,
Monte Carlo methods only incur error associated with input parameters such as
cross sections or geometry specifications, but it is challenging to achieve a
global solution with constant statistical error using this
approach. Computationally, deterministic methods typically suffer memory and
runtime costs that scale with the
