\chapter{Signed Distance Field Preconditioning}\label{ch:preconditioning}

This chapter describes the adaptation of a rendering data structure, the Signed
Distance Field (SDF), as a tool for accelerating CAD-based transport in the Direct
Accelerated Monte Carlo (DAGMC) toolkit. A model for predicting the data
structure's utilization in simulation is also introduced. Finally,
demonstrations of its effectiveness for a number of simple problems and
production models are shown and discussed.

Signed distance fields are typically represented using a mesh-based structure
such as a Cartesian grid as depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:preconditioner_datastruct} or an Octree. Associated with each vertex in
the mesh is a signed value representing the distance to the nearest surface of
the geometry. Signed distance values can be constructed for arbitrary locations
within the mesh by interpolating the stored values of the vertices for the mesh
element containing the point. These interpolated signed distance values can then
be used to quickly provide local geometric information for Monte Carlo queries
in simulation.

\section{Preconditioning Theory}\label{sec:preconditioner_theory}

Of the geometric queries that DAGMC supports, \textit{Next Surface},
\textit{Point Containment}, and \textit{Closest Surface} are most commonly
called in simulations.  At least one ray is fired to satisfy any of these
queries in DAGMC with $O(log \, N_{triangles})$ complexity using MOAB's BVH, but it is
hypothesized that these queries can be accelerated in many cases. For each of
the fundamental Monte Carlo geometries outlines below, signed distance values
are recovered from the signed distance field via interpolation of the field
values and used to precondition ray fire calls in DAGMC.


\precondQuery{Point Containment}
              {point_containment_sdf}
              {Examples of scenarios for point containment preconditioning using
                signed distance values. For locations far from the surface
                boundary, the sign of interpolated signed distance value can be
                used to determine point containment. Locations close to the
                surface with interpolated values less than the interpolation
                error, $\epsilon$, cannot be used to determine point
                containment. }
              {
                \textit{Point Containment} queries can be preconditioning by examining
                the interpolated signed distance value for the current particle
                location. If the point's value is negative (or outside of the
                SDF), then the point is considered to be outside of the
                volume. If the point's value is positive, then the point is
                determined to be inside the volume.

                Given that there is error associated with each of these
                interpolated values, the result of this method should only be
                trusted if the absolute value of the signed distance is greater
                than the expected error associated with the value. If
                this is not the case, then a ray must be fired to determine the
                particle's containment with respect to the volume in
                question. In effect, this verifies that the location is far
                enough from the boundary of the volume to make a definitive
                statement about whether it is inside or outside of the volume
                based on the sign of its interpolated signed distance value.
                Figure \ref{fig:point_containment_sdf} graphically describes the
                outcome of these different cases in two dimensions.

             {Examples of scenarios for next surface intersection
               preconditioning using signed distance values. Various scenarios
               are shown in which the signed distance values can be used to
               avoid a ray fire query by confirming the absence of a surface
               crossing between the particle's current location and physics
               event location. } {
               \textit{Next Surface} intersection queries are the most common
               geometry query in Monte Carlo simulations as demonstrated in
               Table \ref{tab:geom_query_ratios}. These queries are initiated by
               native Monte Carlo codes to determine if a particle will cross a
               surface before reaching its next physics event location. Normally
               in DAGMC a ray is fired each time this query is called. This can
               be avoided by using the signed distance field to exclude the
               possibility of a surface crossing without explicitly determining
               the next surface intersection. If the sum of the signed distance
               values for both the current particle position and the next
               physics event location is greater than the distance between the
               two locations, then it can be guaranteed that there is no surface
               crossing along the path between those two points. The
               interpolated signed distance value represents the minimum
               distance to any surface for a given location. The signed distance
               value of the current location ensures that some portion of the
               particle's track from the current location to the physics even
               location is empty space. The signed distance value of the physics
               event location also ensures that a portion of the particle's
               track is empty space. If the entire track length can be accounted
               for, then no surface crossing exists between the two
               locations. Thus the particle can safely advance to the next
               physics event location without firing a ray to determine the
               exact distance to the next surface. Figure
               \ref{fig:next_surface_sdf} depicts these different cases in 2D
               space.
               
               For robustness, the error for each interpolation should be
               subtracted from the sum of the signed distance values as a
               protective measure against invalid surface crossings. If the
               expanse between the particle's current location and its next
               physics event location cannot be accounted for by the signed
               distance values of the two points, then the exact next surface
               intersection will be found using a ray fire
               call. It is acknowledged that not all
               Monte Carlo codes provide the next physics event location along
               with the particle's current location to their geometry
               kernels. In this case, preconditioning of these queries in this
               manner will not be possible.
              }

\precondQuery{Closest Surface}
             {closest_surface_sdf}
             {Examples of scenarios for closest surface preconditioning using
               signed distance values. Signed distance values interpolated from
               the SDF can be used to quickly return an approximate nearest
               surface location.}
             {
               \textit{Closest Surface} queries can be performed in a similar manner to
               \textit{Point Containment} queries, but they are more dependent on the
               native code's intent for their use. Some Monte Carlo codes always
               query for the closest surface intersection in order to
               determine whether or not the particle will exit the volume before
               reaching its next physics event location. This information can be
               interpolated from a signed distance field to the same effect.
               
               In similar fashion to the point containment case, the signed
               distance value should only be trusted if it is greater than the
               error associated with the value. Additionally, the error should
               be subtracted from the value, returning to the code a
               conservative value for the nearest intersection. If the signed
               distance value's magnitude is not greater than its error
               evaluation or if the value is negative, then a ray should be
               fired to determine the exact location of the nearest boundary
               crossing for the particle's location. Figure
               \ref{fig:closest_surface_sdf} depicts these different cases in a
               2D example.
             }
             
Using these methods, signed distance fields can act as a preconditioning tool
for the relatively expensive ray fire process to accelerated CAD-based MCRT by
using an $O(1)$ process to establish that the conditions of a geometric query
are such that a more computationally expensive ray fire is necessary before
performing the ray tracing operation. It is hypothesized that for some Monte
Carlo problems this process can be used to avoid $O(log \, N_{triangles})$ ray fire calls to
significantly reduce the runtime of the simulation.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Construction}

As an initial implementation, one signed distance field is generated for each
volume in DAGMC with extents matching the axis-aligned bounding box of the
volume. The signed distance field is represented as a uniform structured mesh
with a signed distance value at each vertex in the mesh as indicated in Figure
\ref{fig:sdf_sphere}.

MOAB provides an interface for construction of structured meshes which stores
explicit vertex coordinates, hex elements, and entity handles. As with any
entity stored in MOAB, tag data can be applied to these elements. These vertex
coordinates and hex elements can be accessed using $<i,j,k>$ indexing, where the
coordinate $<0,0,0>$ and $<N_{x}, N_{y}, N_{z}>$ represent the lowest and
highest corner of the structured mesh in parameter space for a mesh containing
$N_{x},N_{y},N_{z}$ elements in the x, y, and z directions respectively. This
representation provides a fast path for verification, visualization, and proof
of concept in transport test cases for demonstration, but is relatively memory
intensive due to the dense nature of the data structure and explicit mesh
element information stored in the database. To reduce  memory consumption,
an implicit version of the structured mesh has been implemented which takes
advantage of the uniform step size in each dimension to store only: the number
of elements in the mesh, the location of the lowest corner in that mesh, and a
flat array of the signed distance values associated with the elements of the
mesh.
%A much less memory intensive implementation in which only a box
%corner, grid step size, dimensions, and the signed distance value data are
%stored has now also been implemented.
This avoids the storage of vertex coordinates, mesh element connectivity, and
all associated handles to those entities. There is an added cost in re-computing
vertex coordinates when a signed distance value is interpolated, but this added
cost is negligible in comparison to a ray traversal and memory is of greater
concern for this spatially dense data structure. This data structure can still
interact with MOAB's structured mesh interface to generate an explicit mesh for
visualization and verification if required.

%% An initial implementation of the signed distance field employed MOAB's
%% structured mesh interface and data tagging capabilites for storage of the data

  \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{../images/sdf_sphere.png}
  \caption[Visualization of a signed distance field created in MOAB.]{A visual
    of a signed distance field with step size 0.5 cm surrounding the spherical
    volume of test case with a radius of 10 cm.}
  \label{fig:sdf_sphere}
\end{figure}

Signed distance values can be retrieved from the structured mesh by determining
which mesh voxel the point lies within. The point's element is accessed by
determining an $<i,j,k>$ index using the point's x, y, and z values divided by
the structured mesh step size. A tri-linear interpolation of the mesh element's 8
vertex coordinates and their signed distance values is then used to provide the
signed distance value for the location of interest. As a result, the complexity
of a signed distance value look-up from the signed distance field is an
$O(1)$ operation.

\subsection{Population}

Signed distance fields are typically generated using an implicit, analytic
representation, but a suitable data structure for populating the structured mesh
with signed distance values is already in place in the form of DAGMC's bounding
volume hierarchy. It is a more straightforward process to simply use DAGMC's
current \textit{Closest Surface} algorithm to generate signed distance values than to
create an implicit surface approximation of the triangle mesh. This method also
maintains a consistency between the intersections found by the ray tracing
kernel and the values stored in the signed distance field.

DAGMC's \textit{Closest Surface} algorithm returns, among other pieces of
information, the nearest intersection location and the triangle on which this
intersection exists. For each point in the signed distance field mesh, this
algorithm is used to determine the magnitude of the distance value. To
accomplish this, a ray is constructed from query location to the intersection
location. The dot product of this ray vector with the triangle's outward normal
vector is used to determine the sign of the distance value. DAGMC maintains
enough information to consistently orient triangle normals such that they point
outward from the volume they represent. In the rare cases for which the dot
product of these vectors is ambiguous, or zero, DAGMC's point containment
algorithm is used to disambiguate the value's sign.

\section{Preconditioner Utilization}\label{sec:preconditioner_utilization}

In effect, the preconditioner is attempting to check whether or not the particle
will actually cross a surface before explicitly searching for the particle's
intersection with a surface along its current trajectory. If the result of this
preconditioning check is always false and a ray is always fired, then these
checks are only adding to the computational cost of the problem. This will
always occur in volumes filled with void, for example, as particles immediately
travel from one side of a volume to another. To avoid low-utilization scenarios,
the signed distance field should be applied selectively depending on each
volume's geometric and material properties for optimal performance and high
utilization of the preconditioning methods. Ideally, this method will only be
applied to volumes in which the preconditioning method is able to avoid ray fire
calls often or with high utilization. The signed distance field is expected to
have the biggest impact in performance when preconditioning \textit{Next Surface}
intersection queries, as they are most commonly called in Monte Carlo codes when
tracking  particles through the geometry (see Table
\ref{tab:geom_query_ratios}). As such, this type of query is the focus of
utilization measurement for the remainder of this section.


\begin{equation}
  U = \frac{ \small \text{Rays Avoided w/ SDF} }{ \small \text{Number of Geometry Queries} } 
   \label{eq:preconditioner_utilization}
%  \caption{Definition of signed distance field utilization as a ray fire preconditioner in DAGMC.}
\end{equation}

The utilization of the SDF preconditioning method, conceptually defined in
Equation \eqref{eq:preconditioner_utilization}, can be described as the number of
ray fire calls related to the \textit{Next Surface} intersection queries that
are avoided divided by the total number of next surface intersection queries
made by the Monte Carlo code. This value can be quantified using this definition
using debugging tools, such as Valgrind \cite{Pena_2016}, to determine the
number of queries made in DAGMC and the number of rays fired inside of the
subroutine.  It is expected that, as the utilization of preconditioning methods
goes up, the performance of the simulation will also improve.

  \caption[Utilization results for a simple SDF test case.]{Utilization results

    density was varied from 0 to 1 $\frac{g}{cm^3}$.}
  \label{fig:sphere_hydrogen_density_study_util}
\end{figure}

To understand this utilization more deeply with respect to material parameters,
a simple problem was create to demonstrate the performance benefits of this
method. The density of a hydrogen-filled sphere of radius 10cm and centered on
the origin was varied from 0 to 1 $\frac{g}{cm^3}$ with a 5 MeV neutron point
source at the origin. For each density, one simulation was performed without the
signed distance field and another with the signed distance field and
preconditioning enabled. Figure \ref{fig:sphere_hydrogen_density_study_util}
shows the utilization results of this study.

\begin{figure}[ht]

  \includesvg{../images/sdf_hydrogen_density_study_perf}{width=1.1\textwidth}
  \caption[A DAG-MCNP test simulation applying the signed distance
    field.]{Performance results for a 5 MeV neutron source at the origin of a 10
    cm radius sphere. Hydrogen density was varied from 0.0 to 1.0
    $\frac{g}{cm^3}$. Simulations of 100M histories at each density were
    performed using native MCNP5, DAG-MCNP5 without the signed distance field,
    and DAG-MCNP5 with the signed distance field.}
  \label{fig:sphere_hydrogen_density_study_perf}
\end{figure}

Utilization of the preconditioning method in this study remains high until the
hydrogen density falls to 0.1 $\frac{g}{cm^3}$ at which point a distinct knee
appears and the utilization falls off quickly. Even at the lowest density
reached in the study of 0.01 $\frac{g}{cm^3}$, the utilization preconditioning
method is 0.54.


Figure \ref{fig:sphere_hydrogen_density_study_perf} provides some insight into the
impact of the preconditioning method on the simulation. The run times
of three implementations  converge as the density of the
hydrogen is varied. As the hydrogen density approaches 1.0 $\frac{g}{cm^3}$, a
factor of ~3.5 improvement in runtime is seen in the simulation where the SDF is
applied as a preconditioner. The application of the signed distance field allows
for significantly improved performance until the density drops below 0.1
$\frac{g}{cm^3}$ in agreement with utilization plot. As the material density
decreases, particles quickly leave the geometry after very few collisions. It is
difficult to judge the impact on the performance of this simulation for these
low density values due to the limited size of the geometry and the short lived
histories.  In order to have more control over a simulation's physical
parameters, subsequent experiments were performed using a pseudo Monte Carlo
simulation tool.

\subsection{Utilization Modeling}

In order to characterize utilization of a signed distance field as a
preconditioner for \textit{Next Surface} intersection queries in DAGMC, a pseudo Monte
Carlo simulation tool was developed using DAGMC. This tool was used to simulate
different transport scenarios within a spherical geometry of radius 100
cm. Particles were sourced uniformly inside the volume and scatter
isotropically. Particle histories are terminated based on a maximum number of
collisions or departure from the problem geometry. Particle distance traveled,
$d$, can be represented by either a fixed distance or by sampling for the
standard probability of interaction in a medium with mean free path,
$\lambda$. The tool allows the value of $\lambda$ to be set directly, enabling a
relation between the signed distance field and this value to be developed with
intent for use as a means to characterize appropriate
conditions for application of the signed distance field.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includesvg{../images/sdf_fixed_dist_results}{width=\textwidth}
  \caption[Pseudo-simulation results for the fixed distances traveled.]{Results
    of the model for the theoretical utilization limit with the results of the
    simulation for a fixed distance traveled case.}
  \label{fig:sdf_fixed_dist}    
\end{figure}

To begin, simulations were performed for particles with a fixed distance
traveled for varying distances and signed distance field step sizes. Run times
of the simulation are not shown here as the data structure's utilization is the
main focus of this study. The results of the study are shown in
 Figure \ref{fig:sdf_fixed_dist}. As the signed distance field mesh step size
increases, utilization of the preconditioning method structure decreases due to the increasing
error associated with the interpolation of signed distance values. Additionally,
utilization is expected to decrease with increasing distance traveled. This
decreased utilization is caused by not only the increased distance between the
two particles, but also by the increased probability that both locations will be
closer to surfaces of the sphere and have smaller signed distance values. A
theoretical limit developed by the author for the preconditioning method
utilization is also shown in Figure \ref{fig:sdf_fixed_dist}. The development of
this analytic limit will now be discussed.

  \caption[Depiction of utilization model variables.]{Depiction of utilization
    model variables.}
  \label{fig:model}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Analytic Model Development}
  
The utilization of the signed distance field as a preconditioner for ray tracing
operations can be modeled as an evaluation of the combined probability space for
particles with a current position, $\vec{p}$, and a next physics event location,
$\vec{n}$, some distance, $d$, apart. The fraction of this probability
space in which signed distance values can be used to rule out surface crossings
for next surface intersections is considered to be the theoretical
utilization of the signed distance field. An general form for this probability
space can found in Equation \eqref{eq:util_model}.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:util_model}
\int_{V_{sphere}}\int_{V_{track}} p_p(r) p_n(d) \, \mathrm{d}V_{sphere}\mathrm{d}V_{track}
\end{equation}

In this model, the starting location of particles, $\vec{p}_{p}(r,\phi,\theta)$, is
uniformly distributed, $p_p(r)=1$, throughout a sphere of radius, $R$, centered
at the origin.  The location of the next event, $\vec{p}_{n}(d,\alpha,\beta)$, where $d$
is the distance traveled by the particle, $\alpha$ is the interior angle between
the particle's position vector and the particle's sampled direction
vector, and $\beta$ represents an azimuthal angle for directions traveled with
angle of departure, $\alpha$. Figure \ref{fig:model} depicts these variables, $r$,
$d$, and $\alpha$ graphically.

In order to represent particles traveling a fixed distance, the relationship in
Equation \eqref{eq:pn_fixed} is applied.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pn_fixed}
  p_n(d) = \frac{\delta(d-\lambda)}{d^{2}}
\end{equation}

The evaluation of this integral provides a representation of all the query
space available to the problem

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:A_fixed}
\small A = 8\pi^2  \int_{0}^{R}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\pi} \delta(d-\lambda) \,
r^2 \, \sin{\alpha} \, \mathrm{d}\alpha \mathrm{d}d \, \mathrm{d}r
\end{equation}

and represents all geometric query space, labeled $A$, for a sphere of radius,
$R$ and a fixed distance traveled, $\lambda$.

In order to understand what fraction of this query space is able to be
preconditioned, the condition for avoiding an explicit nearest intersection
search along a particle direction in Equation \eqref{eq:condition_no_error} will now be
applied.

\begin{equation}
  SDV(\vec{p}) + SDV(\vec{n}) > |\vec{p}-\vec{n}|
  \label{eq:condition_no_error}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
 &SDV - \, Signed \, Distance \, Value \, function \\
 &\vec{p} - \, particle's \, current \, position \\
 &\vec{n} - \, particle's \, next \, event \, location \\
 &h - \, mesh \, step \, size \\
\end{align*}

This condition establishes that the nearest location to intersection for both
points must be greater than the distance between the two points plus any error
associated with their signed distance values as previously described in Section
\ref{sec:preconditioner_theory}. This condition is true for some fraction of
the next surface queries in a Monte Carlo simulation, but not all. The signed
distance function of a sphere, shown in Equation \eqref{eq:sdf_sphere}, can be
applied in Equation \eqref{eq:condition_no_error}, to obtain a lower limit,
$\alpha_{min}$ for the integral over $d\alpha$ in Equation \eqref{eq:util_model}.

\begin{equation}
  SDV(\vec{x}) =  R-|\vec{x}|
  \label{eq:sdf_sphere}
\end{equation}

Making these substitutions into the inequality gives

\begin{equation}
  \alpha_{min} > \arccos\Bigg ( \frac{(2R-r-d)^2-d^2-r^2}{2 d r} \Bigg )
  \label{eq:alpha_min_no_error_fixed}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includesvg{../images/model_cases_fixed_distance}{width=\textwidth}
  \caption[Depiction of utilization modeling scenarios.]{Depiction of
    utilization modeling scenarios. Left: an example of a track for which $d < R
    - r$. Middle: an example of a track for which $R-r < d < R$ and can be
    preconditioned.  Right: an example of a track for which $R-r < d < R$ and
    cannot be preconditioned.}
  \label{fig:modeling_cases}
\end{figure}

This condition on alpha can be interpreted as a minimum interior angle that the
particle's trajectory must take relative to the particle's position vector,
$\vec{p}$, for a distance traveled, $d$, for a ray fire to be avoided and the
preconditioner to be utilized. The examination of this condition as a function
of the distance traveled for various values of $r$ results in some conclusions
about how signed distance values are being utilized.

The inequality in Equation \eqref{eq:alpha_min_no_error_fixed} is undefined until the distance reaches a value $d = R- r$. This
is because the angular limit only needs to be applied to areas of the query
space in which the distance traveled is large enough to violate the above
condition as depicted in  Figure \ref{fig:modeling_cases}. A violation of this
limit may only occur when a particle travels far enough to reach the geometric
sphere boundary along the current position vector as if it were moving directly
toward the boundary of the sphere.

A plot of the $\alpha_{min}$ limit for various radial starting positions and
distances traveled can be found in \ref{fig:alpha_min}. An interesting feature
of this figure is the convergence of all the curves on $\pi$ as $d$ approaches
$R$. The convergence on $\pi$ indicates that as the distance traveled approaches
$R$ the only direction that the particle can move is back toward the origin
along the position vector. It also defines a maximum distance a particle can
travel in the sphere and still be preconditioned using signed distance
values. Intuitively this makes sense as the maximum chord length of a sphere is
$2R$, and once a particle travels a distance $R$ the sum of the signed distance
values can then be no larger than $R$. Thus the condition for utilization in
Equation \eqref{eq:condition} is always violated for distances traveled greater
than $R$. Hence all curves go to zero at $\lambda
= 100 cm$ in Figure \ref{fig:sdf_fixed_dist}. Substitution of the $\alpha_{min}$
condition gives

\begin{equation}
\small US = 8\pi^2  \int_{0}^{R}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{\boldsymbol{\alpha_{min}}}^{\pi} \delta(d-\lambda) \,
r^2 \, d^2 \sin{\alpha} \, \mathrm{d}\alpha \mathrm{d}d \, \mathrm{d}r
\label{eq:subs_a_cond}
\end{equation}

Evaluating this integral and dividing by all query space gives the
following form for the theoretical limit of signed distance field utilization as a
preconditioner for ray firing

\begin{equation}
  U_{fixed} = \frac{US}{A} =  \frac{(1-H(\lambda-R))(2R-\lambda)(R-\lambda)}{2R^2}
  \label{eq:sdf_util_fixed}
\end{equation}

It can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:sdf_fixed_dist} that this utilization limit
works well as an upper limit for the simulation results for various signed
distance field mesh resolutions. Equation \eqref{eq:sdf_util_fixed} is an
idealized model and does not account for interpolation error of the signed
distance values used in the pseudo simulation. As the step size of the mesh
approaches zero, so does the evaluation of the error and the utilization values
approach the idealized analytic model for the preconditioner utilization.

%% Section \ref{sec:sdf_other_geoms} will include the comparison of this
%% utilization limit to other single-volume geometries using dimensionless
%% parameters to determine if the model above can be used to predict signed
%% distance field utilization in other geometries as well.

%% Following the same process as in the fixed distance case by plugging Equation \eqref{eq:pn_sampled} into

%% \end{equation}

%% The results of this set of simulations can be seen in
%%  Figure \ref{fig:sdf_sampled_dist}. In this scenario, it is not expected that the
%% utilization will approach zero when $\lambda = 100\, cm$, as the actual distance
%% sampled may be considerably less than the provided mean free path for the
%% simulation. Overall utilization values in this scenario for $\lambda$ from 0 to
%% 100 cm remain higher than the corresponding fixed distance simulation cases as
%% is expected in a sampled distance case. Utilization values remain high for
%% relatively large increases in mesh step size, $h$. This is important to
%% application of the data structure given concerns regarding its potentially high
%% memory footprint for large volumes. For example if the utilization of the signed
%% distance field drops $~20\%$ when going from a step size of 1 cm to 6.21 cm, but
%% the memory footprint of the data structure will have decreased by a factor of
%% $6.21^3$ or $239.5$ as well. The optimization of the mesh step size with respect
%% to its effect on utilization will also need to be included in future models of
%% the utilization.

The fixed distance traveled scenario provides a baseline for agreement between
the computational results and the model, but a more realistic scenario is
required before attempting to apply the model as a predictive utility for
application of the SDF in true Monte Carlo codes. The next iteration of the
analytic model applies a sampled next physics event distance based on the
probability for distance to interaction in a medium with a total cross section,
$\Sigma$.

\begin{equation}
  p = \frac{e^{-\Sigma d}}{d^{2}} = \frac{e^{-\frac{d}{\lambda}}}{d^{2}}
\end{equation}

where in this case now $\lambda$ represents the mean free path of the particle in the medium

In simulation, distances are now sampled as

\begin{equation}
  d = -\lambda ln(c)
\end{equation}

where $c$ is randomly sampled with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. To
find the portion of utilized space for a given $R$ and $\lambda$ one can apply
the same methods from the fixed distance case.  Appendix \ref{ch:appendix-a}
provides a more detailed description of the model development for sampled
distances. The result of the updated distribution for sampled distances is found
in Equation \eqref{eq:sdf_model_sampled}. Applying this distribution to Equation
\eqref{eq:util_model} gives

\begin{equation}
  8\pi^{2} \int_{0}^{R}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{\alpha_{min}}^{\pi}
-r^2\sin{\phi} \, \lambda c ln(c)^2 \sin{\alpha} \, \mathrm{d}\alpha \mathrm{d}d
\, \mathrm{d}r
\end{equation}


%% Another way of viewing of
%% viewing this condition in the case of a sampled distance traveled is to define
%% these same categories based on the distance traveled. Now rather than defining
%% how the angular condition is applied based on position, the angular condition
%% will be applied based on the distance the particle travels.

%% for each particle position
%% within the sphere there will still be two scenarios - one in which the distance
%% traveled exceeds $R-d$ and another in which it is less than $R-d$. The difference
%% now is d has become a distrubution rather than a constanct value, so as the
%% distance traveled changes the queries will fall into either category for a
%% single particle position.

%% \begin{equation}
%%   d < R-r : \alpha_{min} = 0
%% \end{equation}

%% \begin{equation}
%%   d > R-r : \alpha_{min} = \arccos\Bigg ( \frac{(2R-r-d)^2-d^2-r^2}{2 d r} \Bigg
%%   )
%% \end{equation}

%% It is interesting to examine plots of the angular limit with varying distance as
%% seen in Figure \ref{fig:alpha_min}.

%% \begin{figure}[ht]

%%   \includesvg{../images/alpha_r}{width=1\textwidth}
%%   \caption{Plot of mininum angle of departure restriction for particles with
%%     various radial positions between 0 cm and 100 cm and various distanced traveled.}
%%  \label{fig:alpha_min}
%% \end{figure}

%% The entry point of each curve in the plot represents the minimum distance
%% necessary to enter the $d > R-r$ region and begins to apply an agular
%% restriction. Note that each of these approach a mininmum angle of $\pi$ as the
%% distance traveled approaches $R$ (100cm). This represents a particle traveling
%% back towrd the origin along the sphere's larges chord with length $2R$ and,
%% again,the maximum distance a particle can travel before the SDF can no longer be
%% utilized.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    U_{sampled} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \lambda (R - 2 \lambda) e^{-\frac{R}{\lambda}} + \lambda^{2} - \frac{3}{2} R \lambda + R^{2} }{R^{2}}
  \end{split}
  \label{eq:sdf_model_sampled}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:sdf_sampled_dist}, the updated predictive model
describes the idealized utilization of the preconditioning method very well when
the SDF step size is small. As the SDF step size is increased, the predictive
model becomes increasingly worse at evaluating the correct utilization. For the
predictive model to be useful in a production scenario, the relationship of the
preconditioning method's utilization to the SDF step size must be understood as
well. This relationship can be drawn through the SDF interpolation error,
$\epsilon$, which is a function of the mesh step size, $h$.

%% It is quite possible that utilization in either th interior or exterior
%% resion of the sphere is being under represented. Regardless of the cause, examining the contribution to
%% utilization from each of these regions (shown in
%%  Figure \label{fig:util_region_contributions}) is an interesting endeavor.

%% \label{fig:util_region_contributions}
%% \end{figure}

%% Figure \ref{fig:util_region_contributions} depicts the utilization of the SDF
%% data structure for various values of the mean free path, $\lambda$.
%% When $\lambda$ is very small, particles' next event locations
%% rarely reach the outer region condition of $ d > R - r $. As $\lambda$ increases, particles are
%% more likely to enter that region and its contribution increases greatly. Then
%% as particles begin to travel distances on the order of the sphere radius the
%% utilization decreases. The interior region utilization acts as one would
%% expect. When particles travel small distances with respect to the sphere radius,
%% there is high utilization, but as the particles begin to travel further its
%% utilization rapidly decreases. The contribution from the outer region defines the
%% significance of using both the current position signed distance value as well as the
%% next event location's signed distance value to precondition ray fire calls in DAGMC.

\subsection{Applying SDF Error Evaluation}

Thus far, the error associated with the tri-linear interpolation used to recover
signed distance values from the signed distance field has been ignored. In order
to optimize step size of the uniform mesh making up the signed distance field,
it is important to take this error into account when predicting the utilization
of the data structure. The error associated with any linear interpolation is, to
first order, dependent on the second order partial derivatives of the function
being approximated and the sampling frequency of the points used for
interpolation. This relationship is described in two dimensions via the Taylor
expansion of the formula for a bi-linear interpolation in Figure
\ref{fig:interpolation_err_2d}. For the case of a signed distance field sampled
from a surface boundary, the error can be estimated by using the maximum local
curvature of the surface as a conservative estimate of the partial
derivative. However, in the case of a discretized mesh, this would be
prohibitively computationally expensive to evaluate. Instead, a conservative
estimate of the error based on the mesh size is used to ensure invalid geometric
information is not returned from signed distance value recovery in the SDF.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{equation}
    \epsilon = \frac{1}{2} \Delta x (h-\Delta x) \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} \Delta y (h-\Delta y)  \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{align*}
    h - & \, mesh\, interval\, size \\
    \Delta x - & \, x\, distance\, to\, interpolation\, point\, from\, data\, point \\
    \Delta y - & \, y\, distance\, to\, interpolation\, point\, from\, data\, point \\
    u(x,y) - &\, sampled\, function\, on\, mesh \\
    \epsilon - & \, error \\
  \end{align*}
  \caption[Taylor expansion of a bi-linear interpolation.]{Taylor expansion of 2D
    interpolation equation as an estimate for the error of a function sampled
    onto a structured Cartesian mesh.}
  \label{fig:interpolation_err_2d}
\end{figure}

The error estimate used in this work is equal to the largest diagonal of the
mesh elements in the uniform SDF grid, $\sqrt{3}h$, and ensures that signed
distance values cannot be used improperly to determine that a ray query can be
avoided during simulation.


As seen in Figure \ref{fig:sdf_sampled_dist}, the step size of the mesh can
significantly impact the utilization of the data structure and in turn the
overall performance of the simulation. It is important to use a step size which
will not limit the effect of the data structure, but the signed
distance field is a dense data structure and uses a considerable amount of
memory. The memory usage of the signed distance field is inversely proportional
to the cube of the mesh step size ($\alpha \frac{1}{h^{3}}$). Therefore it is
important to consider the impact that this error will have on the utilization
of the data structure.

\begin{equation}
  SDV(\vec{p}) + SDV(\vec{n}) > |\vec{p}-\vec{n}| + 2\varepsilon(h)
  \label{eq:condition}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
 &SDV - \, signed \, distance \, value \, function \\
 &\vec{p} - \, particle's \, current \, position \\
 &\vec{n} - \, particle's \, next \, event \, location \\
 &h - \, mesh \, step \, size \\
 &\varepsilon(h) - \, error \, evaluation \, for \, signed \, distance \, \, values \\
\end{align*}

The expansion of Equation \eqref{eq:condition_no_error} with the error term can be seen
in \eqref{eq:condition} and results in a new condition for the minimum angle of
departure ($\alpha_{min}$) shown in Equation \eqref{eq:min_alpha_w_error}

\begin{equation}
\small
\begin{split}
\alpha_{min} =& \arccos\Bigg ( \frac{(2R-r-d-2\epsilon)^2-d^2-r^2}{2 d r} \Bigg )
\end{split}
\label{eq:min_alpha_w_error}
\end{equation}

This formulation of $\alpha_{min}$ can be used directly in the integration described
in Equation \eqref{eq:subs_a_cond}. The final form of the model after the
integration is described in Equation \eqref{eq:sdf_util_sampled_w_error}. Again, a
more detailed development of this model is provided in Appendix \ref{ch:appendix-a}.

\begin{equation}
  US_{sampled} = \frac{(R-\epsilon) (\frac{1}{2} \lambda ( R - 2\lambda - \epsilon ) e^{\frac{-R + \epsilon}{\lambda}} + \lambda^{2} - \frac{3}{2}\lambda(R - \epsilon) + (R-\epsilon)^{2})}{R^3}
  \label{eq:sdf_util_sampled_w_error}
\end{equation}

%% For a direct evaluation of the utilization based on
%% the mesh step size, $h$, the formula for the error can be substituted for
%% $\epsilon$ to give

%% \begin{equation}
%% \small
%% \begin{split}
%% \alpha_{min} =& (H(d-(R-r-\sqrt{3}h))-H(d-(R-\sqrt{3}h))) \arccos\Bigg ( \frac{(2R-r-d-2\sqrt{3}h)^2-d^2-r^2}{2 d r} \Bigg ) \\
%% &+ \pi \, H(d-(R-\sqrt{3}h))
%% \end{split}
%% \end{equation}

This model in Equation \eqref{eq:sdf_util_sampled_w_error} was compared to
pseudo-simulations using sampled distances for the next physics event
location. The result of this study can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:sdf_util_sampled_distance_w_error}. The dimensionless parameters $n$
and $c$ as formulated by normalizing the mean free path, $\lambda$ and the mesh
step size, $h$ using the average chord length of the sphere, $R_{av}$. These
dimensionless parameters are useful for describing the utilization in
generalized terms of the geometry. This is discussed in more detail in
Section \ref{sec:sdf_other_geoms}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includesvg{../images/sdf_util_sampled_distance_w_error}{width=\textwidth}
  \caption[Preconditioner utilization model accounting for interpolation
    error.]{Theoretical limits for SDF utilization accounting for error
    evaluation plotted with simulation results for varying mesh step sizes.}
  \label{fig:sdf_util_sampled_distance_w_error}
\end{figure}

The model presented in Equation \eqref{eq:sdf_util_sampled_w_error} agrees very
well with the simulated results for small values of $n$. As the value of $n$
increases, the model begins to over-predict the utilization of the
preconditioning method slightly for low relative mean free path values. The
utilization values in this regime are so low that they are not concern,
however. Knowing that the SDF will also be applied to non-spherical geometries
in practice, it is necessary to understand the predictive model's behavior for
other geometries as well.

\subsection{Extension to other geometries}\label{sec:sdf_other_geoms}

To apply this model to other geometries, the mean free path and mesh step size
were normalized using a measure of the free space in a volume compared to its
surface area, the average chord length, $R_{av}$ \cite{Wigner_1981}.  This value
can be defined as seen in Equation \eqref{eq:average_chord_length}.

\begin{equation}
\centering
 R_{av} = \frac{4V}{S}
 \label{eq:average_chord_length}
\end{equation}
\begin{align*}
 &V \, - \, Volume \\
 &S \, - \, Surface \, Area
\end{align*}

Normalizing the mean free path to the average chord length is a way of
describing the probability that a particle will reach the surface of the volume
that is independent of the distance traveled by the particles and the explicit
geometry \cite{Mazzolo_2014}. This in turn allows studies of the utilization to
be performed in a [n=(0,1),c=(0,1)] domain for an arbitrary geometry, mean free
path, and mesh step size.

This common domain of $n$ and $c$ provides a pathway for comparison of the
model in Equation \eqref{eq:sdf_util_sampled_w_error} to other geometries, which
will be important in assessing the utilization of the SDF in arbitrary DAGMC
models. In order to test the extension of this analytic model to other
geometries, pseudo simulations were performed for cylinder and cone
geometries. The results of the utilization model and simulation results can be
found in Figures \ref{fig:sdf_util_sampled_cylinder} and
\ref{fig:sdf_util_sampled_cone}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includesvg{../images/sdf_sampled_cylinder}{width=\textwidth}
  \caption[Application of the utilization model for a cylinder
    geometry.]{Application of the analytic model for preconditioner utilization
    in a cylinder volume for various mean mean free paths, $\lambda$, and mesh
    step sizes, $h$.}
  \label{fig:sdf_util_sampled_cylinder}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includesvg{../images/sdf_sampled_cone}{width=\textwidth}
  \caption[Application of the utilization model for a conic
    geometry.]{Application of the analytic model for preconditioner utilization
    in a cone volume for various mean mean free paths, $\lambda$, and mesh step
    sizes, $h$.}
  \label{fig:sdf_util_sampled_cone}
\end{figure}

For small values of $n$, the utilization model is much closer to the simulated
result. As the value of $n$ increases, however, the model becomes less accurate
in predicting the utilization just as in the spherical geometry. The analytic
model breaks down for values of $n$ which are outside of the limits set by the
$\alpha_{min}$ condition. This is most clearly seen for the $n = 0.5$ trace in
Figure \ref{fig:sdf_util_sampled_cone}. In the spherical case this occurs when
the error evaluation exceeds $R$, meaning that zero utilization of the data
structure is expected. For this condition, any evaluation of the error will
exceed the maximum distance a particle can travel and still be utilized.

\begin{equation}
  \epsilon(h) > R
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \sqrt{3}h = R
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  h = \frac{R}{\sqrt{3}}
  \label{eq:error_condition_sphere}
\end{equation}

To extend this limitation to other geometries, the average chord length will
again be used as a surrogate for the sphere radius in representing the upper
limit of utilization for an arbitrary geometry. For the spherical case, the
average chord length is shown in Equation \eqref{eq:sphere_acl}.

\begin{equation}
  R_{av} = \frac{4}{3}R
  \label{eq:sphere_acl}
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:sphere_acl} can be substituted into Equation
\eqref{eq:error_condition_sphere} to obtain relationship of the mesh step size to
the geometry for an upper limit of $h$ when applying this model in
simulation. This equation can then be normalized to place an upper limit on $n$
for a valid use of the utilization model.

\begin{equation}
 h < h_{max} = \frac{3}{4\sqrt{3}} R_{av}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
 n < n_{max} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \approx 0.433
\label{eq:sdf_max_h}
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:sdf_max_h} provides a value for the maximum allowed normalized
step size for which the utilization model from Equation
\eqref{eq:sdf_util_sampled_w_error} can be applied in an arbitrary geometry. While
unlikely that a step size this large would be applied in practice, it is
important to understand the limitations of this model if it is to be used in an
automated process for application of the data structure either on-the-fly or as
a preprocessing before simulation.

\section{Application in DAGMC Simulations}\label{sec:sdf_production}

The geometry-agnostic version of the utilization model was used to create a
\textit{post facto} analysis script for predicting the SDF's utilization in
production DAG-MCNP models. This analysis uses information about the average
particle track length for each volume as the input mean free path for the
utilization model. This information is gathered from Table 126 provided in MCNP
output files from previous DAGMC simulations of the
geometry\cite{LANL_MCNP5_VOLIII}. The input for the average chord length of each
cell was calculated using DAGMC methods \textit{measure\_volume} and
\textit{measure\_area} for each cell in question. The mesh step size was treated
as a variable used to optimize either the memory usage of the data structure or
the utilization of the data structure depending on options passed into the
script. The output of the script then describes inputs to the utilization model,
the predicted utilization of the data structure, and an estimate of data
structure's memory usage.

This analysis script was used to examine several models to search for volumes
with a significant impact on the simulation. Most of the models used as
benchmarks for timing comparisons in Table \ref{dag-mcnp-benchmarks} did not
contain volumes appropriate for application of the SDF. As a result, other
problems were sought out - several of which simulate charged particles just as
the in the nTOF problem.

In general, the addition of the data structure has a measurable but limited
effect on the performance of the simulations in the production models listed
below. One additional factor that the script takes into account is the number of
collisions in the volumes it is examining. Despite the fact that the collision
density of the transport in a given volume may be high relative to its average
chord length, if a small percentage of the transport occurs in that volume, then
the benefits of applying the SDF are diminished. As an estimate of this, the
ratio of collisions a given volume to the total number of collisions in the
simulation was used as an estimate for the proportion of geometric queries
occurring in the volume.  Additionally, it has been found through profiling of
various simulations that as the collision density increases, the proportion of the
runtime spent querying the geometry is small relative to the time spent calling
physics subroutines.

The SDF preconditioning method was applied in the following models:

Table \ref{tab:sdf_prod_summary} displays the results of simulations in which
the SDF was applied. More detailed information on the parameters of the SDFs and
the volumes they were applied to can be found in Appendix
\ref{ch:appendix-a}. Improvements in the simulation run times varied from
0-35\%. While differences in the run times are significant, they are small in
comparison to those demonstrated in Section \ref{sec:preconditioner_utilization}
for the hydrogen-filled sphere tests. The results in all simulations were
identical regardless of SDF application, however, indicating that the
methodology and error evaluation are robust for at least these production
scenarios.

Despite apparent limitations of the data structure, application in the medical
isotope production model from SHINE (shown in Figure \ref{fig:shine_sdf}) is a
somewhat successful demonstration of the preconditioning method's ability to
reduce simulation run times. A signed distance field with a 0.1 cm step size was
applied to volumes near the bottom of the model which contain both an aqueous
solution of uranium sulfate and a surrounding light water moderator. As outlined
in Table \ref{tab:sdf_prod_summary}, the resulting improvement in performance
for a simulation of 500,000 particles was approximately 35\% of the total
runtime.

For the majority of the production test cases, the preconditioner utilization
model is relatively accurate for the widely varying geometries of the DAGMC
production models.  There are cases in which the model struggles to accurately
predict SDF usage and ray fire query avoidance, however. This an other
observations about the limited effects of the preconditioning method will now be
addressed.

\section{Performance Mitigating Factors}\label{sec:sdf_limitations}

In the majority of the production models to which SDF geometry query
preconditioning was applied, the effect on the overall performance of the
simulation is smaller than what was seen in the simple test cases. This is
due to a variety of factors, each of which is demonstrated by one of the models
in Table \ref{tab:sdf_prod_summary}.

\subsection{Physics Dominant Simulations}\label{subsec:sdf_phys_dominant}

The nTOF model was selected as a charged particle transport demonstration. The
SDF was expected to be extremely beneficial in this scenario due to the high
collision density of charged particle transport relative to the size of certain
volumes in the problem. The computational time spent on the detailed of these
charged particles physics tends to dominate the runtime of the simulation,
leaving little room for improvement in the overall simulation runtime by
reducing geometric query costs.

A neutral particle example of this occurs in SHINE as well. In order to
reduce the amount of time spend in the MCNP kernel for this calculation,
group-wise cross-sections were specified for all materials in the problem. This
allowed the SDF to have a more significant impact on the simulation runtime, but
may not be desirable if continuous energy cross sections are necessary for a
higher fidelity result.

\subsection{Utilization Model Assumptions}\label{subsec:sdf_util_model_limits}

There are some cases in which the SDF utilization model is inaccurate. The
calculation of the average chord length and average track length are assumed to
be true over the entirety of the volume in question. In reality, the localized
average chord length will vary throughout the volume's domain. In cases where
the local value of the average chord length is smaller than predicted, the
utilization model will overestimate the SDF utilization. An example of this was
found in the SNS test model.

A volume representing the mercury manifold in the SNS model was identified as a
good candidate for SDF application. The SDF analysis model estimates the
utilization of the SDF data structure under the assumption that the distribution
of particle interactions in the volume is uniform. In this case, particle
interactions occur mostly in regions of the volume where the local average chord
length is smaller than the average chord length of the entire volume. This
reduces the effectiveness of the SDF for the step size suggested by the input
script. Additionally, an SDF which would provide better utilization would
require a prohibitively small mesh step size in terms of the memory usage of the
data structure. The combination of these effects result in low utilization of
the applied SDF and in turn the simulation runtime is reduced only marginally.

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sns_vol16_flux.png}
  \caption[Mesh tally results of the SNS model.]{Depiction of utilization model
    limitation due to a small local average chord length in the region of high
    collision density.}
  \label{fig:sns_low_util}
\end{sidewaysfigure}

\subsection{Surface Mesh Complexity}\label{subsec:sdf_tree_depth}

In Section \ref{subsec:sdf_phys_dominant} limitations of the SDF impact on the
nTOF simulations were cited as related to the time spent in physics subroutines,
but the faceting of the particular volume which the SDF was applied to may play
a role as well. The volume's faceting contained a relatively small number of
triangles. This in turn means that the generated BVH for this volume was
relatively shallow. The relative improvement in performance when avoiding a ray
traversal is directly related to this tree depth. While the complexity of a BVH
search is $O(log\, N_{tri})$, the cost relative to the $O(1)$ look-up of a signed
distance value in the SDF becomes small as N becomes small, limiting the
effectiveness of the SDF regardless of the utilization.

\section{Summary}

This chapter presented a novel approach to accelerating CAD-based MCRT through
use of signed distance fields to precondition relatively expensive ray fire
calls in the DAGMC geometry kernel. An analytic model was developed to predict
the utilization of this method based on dimensionless geometric and
problem-dependent parameters. The model was shown to be accurate in several
production demonstrations. Though the effectiveness of the preconditioning
method overall was limited by a variety of factors described in Section
\ref{sec:sdf_limitations}, the improvements in simulation runtime with the same
final result were observed.  Enhancement of SDF storage and further model
development in could increase it's impact on these simulations and allow it to
be more broadly applied in future studies.
