\section{Monte Carlo Geometry Queries}

A Monte Carlo geometry kernel must be able to robustly support the types of
geometry queries outlined in Table \ref{tab:monte_carlo_queries}.


\geomQuery{Measure}{
    Given a volume or surface in the geometry, determine properties of that entity
  such as the volume or area.
}

\geomQuery{Point Containment}{
    Given a volume and particle location, determine if the point is inside,
    outside, or on the boundary of that volume.
}

\geomQuery{Next Surface}{
  Given a volume, particle location, and particle trajectory, determine the next
  surface of the volume that the particle intersects along with the distance to
  that intersection.
}

\geomQuery{Next Volume}{
  Given a volume and surface, determine the adjacent volume on the other side of
  the surface.
}

\geomQuery{Closest Surface}{
  Given a volume and particle location, determine the distance to to the nearest
  surface of the volume in any direction.
}


\geomQuery{Surface Normal}{
  Given a surface and particle location, determine the normal vector of the
  surface at a point closest to the particle's location.
}
