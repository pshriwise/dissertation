%% \begin{wbepi}{David C.~Makinson (1965)}
%% It is customary for authors of academic books to include in their prefaces statements such as this: ``I am indebted to ... for their invaluable help; however, any errors which remain are my sole responsibility.'' Occasionally an author will go further. Rather than say that if there are any mistakes then he is responsible for them, he will say that there will inevitably be some mistakes and he is responsible for them....

%% Although the shouldering of all responsibility is usually a social ritual, the admission that errors exist is not --- it is often a sincere avowal of belief. But this appears to present a living and everyday example of a situation which philosophers have commonly dismissed as absurd; that it is sometimes rational to hold logically incompatible beliefs.

%% Above is the famous ``preface paradox,'' which illustrates how to use
%% the \texttt{wbepi} environment for epigraphs at the beginning of
%% chapters.  You probably also want to thank the Academy.

I'd like to thank everyone who helped me along the way both
professionally and personally throughout the course of my PhD work. To
all of my family, teammates, and friends for supporting me and putting
me in a position to be here in the first place. More specifically, I'd
like to thank my mentors Paul Wilson, Andrew Davis, and Tim Tautges
for being excellent professional role models to me, my colleagues in the CNERG research
group - it's been an honor to work with you, and to my wife and family
- the best things in my life.
