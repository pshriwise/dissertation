abstract={Ray tracing requires testing of many rays to determine intersections with objects. A way of reducing the computation is to organize objects into hierarchical data structures. We examine two heuristics for space subdivisions using bintrees, one based on the intuition that surface area is a good estimate of intersection probability, one based on the fact that the optimal splitting plane lies between the spatial median and the object median planes of a volume. Traversal algorithms using cross links between nodes are presented as generalizations of ropes in octrees. Simulations of the surface area heuristic and the cross link scheme are presented. These results generalize to other hierarchical data structures.},

abstract="The problem of finding minimal volume boxes circumscribing a given set of three-dimensional points is investigated. It is shown that it is not necessary for a minimum volume box to have any sides flush with a face of the convex hull of the set of points, which makes a naive search problematic. Nevertheless, it is proven that at least two adjacent box sides are flush with edges of the hull, and this characterization enables anO(n3) algorithm to find all minimal boxes for a set ofn points.",

 abstract = {A fast marching level set method is presented for monotonically advancing fronts, which leads to an extremely fast scheme for solving the Eikonal equation. Level set methods are numerical techniques for computing the position of propagating fronts. They rely on an initial value partial differential equation for a propagating level set function and use techniques borrowed from hyperbolic conservation laws. Topological changes, corner and cusp development, and accurate determination of geometric properties such as curvature and normal direction are naturally obtained in this setting. This paper describes a particular case of such methods for interfaces whose speed depends only on local position. The technique works by coupling work on entropy conditions for interface motion, the theory of viscosity solutions for Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and fast adaptive narrow band level set methods. The technique is applicable to a variety of problems, including shape-from-shading problems, lithographic development calculations in microchip manufacturing, and arrival time problems in control theory.},

	abstract = {A set of improved geometric capabilities are developed for the Direct Accelerated Geometry for Monte Carlo (DAGMC) library to increase its ease of use and accuracy. The improvements are watertight faceting, robust particle tracking, automatic creation of nonsolid space, and overlap tolerance. Before being sealed, adjacent faceted surfaces do not have the same discretization along shared curves. Sealing together surfaces to create a watertight faceting prevents leakage of particles between surfaces. The tracking algorithm is made robust by ensuring numerical consistency and avoiding geometric tolerances. Monte Carlo simulation requires all space to be defined, whether it be vacuum, air, coolant, or a solid material. The implicit creation of nonsolid space reduces human effort otherwise required to explicitly create nonsolid space in a CAD program. CAD models often contain small gaps and overlaps between adjacent volumes due to imprecise modeling, file translation, or intentional deformation. Although gaps are filled by the implicit creation of nonsolid space, overlaps cause geometric queries to become unreliable. The particle tracking algorithm and point inclusion test are modified to tolerate small overlaps of adjacent volumes. Overlap-tolerant particle tracking eliminates manual repair of CAD models and enables analysis of meshed finite element models undergoing structural deformation. These improvements are implemented in a coupling of DAGMC with the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code, known as DAG-MCNP. The elimination of both manual CAD repair and lost particles are demonstrated with CAD models used in production calculations.},

These groups of people, residing in Los Alamos National Laboratory’s X Computational Physics Division, Monte Carlo Codes Group (XCP-3) and Nuclear Engineering and Nonproliferation Division, Radiation Transport Modeling Team (NEN-5) respectively, have combined their code development efforts to produce the next evolution of MCNP. While maintenance and major bug fixes will continue for \{MCNP5\} 1.60 and \{MCNPX\} 2.7.0 for upcoming years, new code development capabilities only will be developed and released in MCNP6. In fact, the initial release of \{MCNP6\} contains numerous new features not previously found in either code. These new features are summarized in this document. Packaged with \{MCNP6\} is also the new production release of the ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data files usable by MCNP. The high quality of the overall merged code, usefulness of these new features, along with the desire in the user community to start using the merged code, have led us to make the first \{MCNP6\} production release: \{MCNP6\} version 1. High confidence in the \{MCNP6\} code is based on its performance with the verification and validation test suites, comparisons to its predecessor codes, our automated nightly software debugger tests, the underlying high quality nuclear and atomic databases, and significant testing by many beta testers.

It is a solid-modeler based preprocessor that meshes volume and surface solid models for finite element analysis. A combination of techniques including paving, mapping, sweeping, and various other algorithms being developed are available for discretizing the geometry into a finite element mesh. CUBIT also features boundary layer meshing specifically designed for fluid flow problems. Boundary conditions can be applied to the mesh through the geometry and appropriate files for analysis generated. CUBIT is specifically designed to reduce the time required to create all-quadrilateral and all-hexahedral meshes. This manual is designed to serve as a reference and guide to creating finite element models in the CUBIT environment. (DOE)",

abstract = {Abstract Photo‐realistic rendering of inhomogeneous participating media with light scattering in consideration is important in computer graphics, and is typically computed using Monte Carlo based methods. The key technique in such methods is the free path sampling, which is used for determining the distance (free path) between successive scattering events. Recently, it has been shown that efficient and unbiased free path sampling methods can be constructed based on Woodcock tracking. The key concept for improving the efficiency is to utilize space partitioning (e.g., kd‐tree or uniform grid), and a better space partitioning scheme is important for better sampling efficiency. Thus, an estimation framework for investigating the gain in sampling efficiency is important for determining how to partition the space. However, currently, there is no estimation framework that works in 3D space. In this paper, we propose a new estimation framework to overcome this problem. Using our framework, we can analytically estimate the sampling efficiency for any typical partitioned space. Conversely, we can also use this estimation framework for determining the optimal space partitioning. As an application, we show that new space partitioning schemes can be constructed using our estimation framework. Moreover, we show that the differences in the performances using different schemes can be predicted fairly well using our estimation framework.}
